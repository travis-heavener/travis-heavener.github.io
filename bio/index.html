                        Travis Heavener (HEAVE-nur) is currently a second-year student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute majoring in IT & Web Science. In his spare time, Travis often works on independent programming projects (see <a href="/projects">Projects</a>) or spending time with friends. Travis is a modest car enthusiast and a longtime swimmer, however his athletic interests have shifted more towards weightlifting in recent years.

                    <p class="paragraph-text">
                        Officially beginning in 2017, Travis' self-led journey into code was fueled by an existing passion for computers and all things technology. Travis has taken on projects ranging from web development to machine learning, game development to server programming, and much more. While he has spent a great deal of his time with web development, Travis is never one to shy away from a challenge and is always eager to learn a new language, framework, or library.

                        In recent years, Travis has taken on many projects such as the <a href="https://github.com/travis-heavener/mini-server-2.x">Mini Server v2.1</a>, a home media & file server UI powered by the AMP Stack. Using the React Native framework, Travis also developed the Android app <a href="https://github.com/travis-heavener/seniorresearch">BinGo</a> during a year-long high school research project in his senior year, which encourages users to engage in physical activity through the process of gamification via digital bingo cards.
