In his spare time, he often works on independent programming projects (see <a href=\"/projects/\">Projects</a>). Travis is a longtime swimmer, amateur photographer, and an avid computer enthusiast, applying his diverse range of skills wherever possible.",
                "As early as age twelve, Travis began his self-guided journey into programming, driven by an existing passion for technology. Since then, he has taken on projects spanning full stack development, server programming, machine learning, and more. While his primary area of expertise is web development, Travis actively seeks out new challenges to broaden his skill set."

                "In recent years, Travis has developed several notable projects, including <a href=\"https://wowtravis.com/mercury\">Mercury</a>, a cross-platform, HTTP server made in C++. Using React Native, he also developed the Android app <a href=\"https://github.com/travis-heavener/seniorresearch\">BinGo</a> as part of a year-long high school research project. BinGo encourages physical activity through randomly generated bingo cards that prompt users to explore their surroundings.",
                "Outside of programming, Travis remains active in a variety of pursuits. Throughout high school, Travis worked at Hammerdown BBQ in Aldie, VA, where he gained valuable experience in customer service, food preparation, and leadership. Following graduation, he completed IT internships with Next Phase Solutions and Services in 2023 and 2025. As an IT intern, Travis gained hands-on experience in cloud computing, networking, and cybersecurity. For more information, see <a href=\"/resume/\">Travis' Resume</a>."
