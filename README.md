I have a deep passion for programming and spend much of my free time working on various projects and enjoying time with friends. I gained valuable hands-on experience during an internship with Next Phase Solutions and Services in Columbia, MD in the summer of 2023. Additionally, I honed my customer service skills at Hammerdown BBQ from 2020 to 2023, with a brief return in 2024.
