From [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/travis-heavener/):

> I'm a third-year student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute studying IT & Web Science, with a strong interest in building performant, scalable software systems. I've been programming since age twelve and have pursued both academic and independent projects across full-stack development, server programming, and systems engineering.
> 
> I'm the developer of Mercury, a cross-platform, RFC-compliant HTTP server written in C++, and BinGo, a gamified Android application built with React Native that encourages physical activity through reward-driven progression. While my primary focus is web and backend development, I actively seek out low-level and systems-oriented projects to broaden my skill set.
> 
> Beyond software development, I've gained professional experience through IT internships with Next Phase Solutions and Services in 2023 and 2025, where I worked with cloud infrastructure, networking, and cybersecurity. Earlier roles in customer-facing environments helped shape my communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills.
> 
> Outside of work, I'm a longtime swimmer, amateur photographer, and computer enthusiast who enjoys learning by building.
